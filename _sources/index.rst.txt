`RADii <https://radii.info/>`_ is a collaboration platform for 3D modells.
RADii consists of a Rhino Grasshopper plugin to publish (upload) 3D Models and viewers for different devices (for PC/Mac, VR Glasses or mobile devices) to receive and experience them.
It functions as a direct interface between the model you are working on and its experience.
RADii is being developed by Thomas Lee since 2020. Since 2022 he is colaborating with Gramazio Kohler Research to further develop the tool in the context of the Immersive Design Studio.
More information, updates and the programm can be found at radii.info
This project is still under developement, should you find buggs or out of date documentation please notify us on `Github <https://github.com/Archtica/RADii/issues/>`_
