Review tutorial
**********************************

This tutorial explains and lists what kind of setup is needed for a simple review/discussion in Radii. 
It is based on the fundamentals in the `Basics & Exploration tutorial`_.
In our experience a simple review is a conversation during witch you are free to explore, usually it needs a series of specific views and sections to
guide the conversation. 

For this you need to connect to the `Connect`_ component the:

- PublishGeometry_
- PublishMaterial_
- `Publish View`_
- `Publish Section`_

For more information consol the respective entries.
