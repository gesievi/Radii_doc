Lv Presentation & Story tutorial
**********************************

A presentation in Radii is different from showing plans with strictly defined views and perspectives, the participants can
explore for themselves and you can guide them through your model. This explorative approach 
is more akin to a museum tour, the visit to an existing building or a performance were you are free to explore for yourself and change perspective.

Thus a presentation in Radii can have specific shared elements, this can be done through 
the usage of the PublishAnimation component and the Scenario Manager of the PublishControl component.
With PublishAnimation it is possible to send viewers on defined paths and save a series of controlled moments and interactions with 
PublishControl.
