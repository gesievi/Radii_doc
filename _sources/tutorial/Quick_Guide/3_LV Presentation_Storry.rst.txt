Presentation & Story tutorial
**********************************

A presentation in Radii is different from showing plans, the participants can
explore for themselves and you can guide them through your model. This explorative approach 
is more akin to a physical tour, the visit to an existing building or a performance were you are free to explore for yourself and change perspective.

If you want to show a prepared presentation in Radii that can alternates between defined shared moments and exploration, with an advanced level of changes 
the usage of the `Publish Animation`_ component and the Scenario Manager of the `Publish Control`_ component.
With `Publish Animation`_ it is possible to send viewers on defined paths and with `Publish Control`_ save a series of controlled moments and interactions and switch through them.



For this you need to connect to the `Connect`_ component the:

- PublishGeometry_
- PublishMaterial_
- `Publish View`_
- `Publish Section`_
- `Publish Animation`_
- `Publish Control`_
