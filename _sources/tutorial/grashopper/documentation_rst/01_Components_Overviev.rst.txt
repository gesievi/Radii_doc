There are 4 types of components in Radii Grashopper:
*Connect* is the fundamental component to connect to a channel, it is always connected to all other components that are meant for publishing.
*Publishing* components can send data to a channel and its connected receivers.
*Saving* enables you to save localy to .radii files or on a channel in the cloud.
*Subscribing* imports data from from a connected channel to your local Rhino Grashopper session. The data can then be further processed or saved.
